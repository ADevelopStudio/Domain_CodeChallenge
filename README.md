# Domain_CodeChallenge
Domain Code Challenge

* The code written by yourself must be Swift, Objective-C libraries are fine.

* This should represent code you would be proud to ship as part of the Domain team. Don't try and get too fancy and impress us with an obscure technique/library. There will be plenty of time to discuss those after you complete the challenge.

* Please refrain from the use of storyboards or xib files for the purposes of this exercise.

* Layout code must use Autolayout where appropriate. DSL libraries like SnapKit are acceptable.

* ~~The code must be written to support iOS9+ and all the devices that includes. Assets must be optimised for each device scale. You can get high resolution or vector graphics from The Noun Project or any source your prefer.~~

* Some examples of the use of size classes must be included.

* You are expected to include unit tests where appropriate. You can use XCTest or any other testing framework you prefer.

* You are expected to include Git history and follow the same Git methodology and process as if you were working with others.

* Your project should build with the newest version of Xcode available at the time of your submission.

* Include a brief description of your design goals and any tradeoffs or compromises you made in your README file.
